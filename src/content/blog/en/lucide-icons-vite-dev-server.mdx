> Another story about Javascript bundlersâ€¦

This will be a super short post. It will be like a little story, followed by an analysis, followed by a conclusion. I will try to keep my frustration to myself and stick to the facts, okay? Let's get started.

## Contexte

I'm working on a new project. For this project, I decide to finally use [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/getting-started/what-is-solidstart), the meta framework using the famous [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/). Everything is going well, I really appreciate the technology. Iâ€™m brilliantly integrating my Figma designs, showing extraordinary skill for the day after Christmas dinner.

The time has come for me to spend a few minutes integrating icons. Iâ€™m an average developer but a super mediocre designer, so as always, I decide to use [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/) icons. I grab the package compatible with Solid and import my first icon.

```typescript
import { Twitch } from 'lucide-solid'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <Button leftIcon={<Twitch />} />
}
```

I save my file, I open my Arc browser and then, nothing happens for like... 30 seconds. I don't pay attention, I continue to work, but every time I come back to this specific page, it loads for 30 seconds and then my content appears.

I want to make sure prod is okay, so I build my app, try to access the same page but as you may already know, it loads instantly, meaning that what I experience is a dev only issue.

The frustration is growing, so I decide to stop what I'm doing to conduct a little investigation. I open my `Network` tab, load my page, and this is what I see:

/>

**A THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY REQUESTS!!!!!!!!!!!!** Importing a SINGLE icon makes Vite also include ALL of the icons from Lucide library.

# But, why?

Big question, huh? [Some people have already reproduced this issue](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/issues/1048).

The answer is quite simple: Vite does not perform tree-shaking in development mode and people are not very happy with this design decision [as you can see here](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8237). I'm not going to go into the details of why there is no tree-shaking and the relevance of barrel files (files where you export a bunch of things). I will just say that ESM is supposed to simplify all of this, but it seems like it's still too early.

# Fixing this

In three steps:

First step: Create an alias between a chosen virtual folder and the sources of the lucide library in your `vite.config.js` file.

```typescript
import { fileURLToPath, URL } from "node:url";
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "lucide-solid/icons": fileURLToPath(
        new URL(
          "./node_modules/lucide-solid/dist/source/icons",
          import.meta.url,
        ),
      ),
    },
  },
});
```

Second step: Make typescript understand, in `src/@types/lucide.d.ts`, that we are going to do weird things and that it needs to type everything under our virtual path as a Solid component.

```typescript
declare module "lucide-solid/icons/*" {
  import { LucideProps } from "lucide-solid/dist/types/types";
  import { Component } from "solid-js";
  const cmp: Component<LucideProps>;

  export = cmp;
}
```

Third step: Replace the imports.

```typescript
import Twitch from 'lucide-solid/icon/twitch'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <Button leftIcon={<Twitch />} />
}
```

Fourth step: Be proud of your hard work.

# To conclude

Some lessons I learned:

- How fast your dev env is, is something that matters. Spend some time (not a lot of time) optimizing, and fixing whatâ€™s obviously wrong.
- The intricacies of JavaScript bundling are not as simple as one might think (in reality, no one thinks it is simple).
- Vite does not necessarily mean perfect. Thatâ€™s few things that used to work on Webpack and work differently on Vite. Thatâ€™s not a bad thing but yeah, if you thought Vite is a drop-in replacement of Webpack, your might be wrong!
