As you may know, I built a [Pomodoro Timer](https://concentration.app) while
live streaming on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/LLCoolChris_). This was a fun way
to learn about modern [Expo](https://expo.dev) and share my learnings with my
community. On January 25, I decided to do another round. I'm now rewriting the
very same application, still with Expo, but with **much more features**, cuz you
know, I have to show people **skills**.

Something that people has been asking me to add to my app are **widgets** and
specifically
[live activities](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/live-activities)
on iOS. This article will break down how I did it.

## Requirements

I'm going to assume that you have a basic understanding of React Native and
Expo, as I won't be going deep into Expo-related details. Some Swift basic
knowledge is also appreciated but not required.

Make sure to have an environment ready for React Native, at the time of writing:

- XCode 16.2 (check your version with `xcodebuild -version`)
- Cocoapods 1.16.2
- Node 20+

For this example, we going to use a little blank Expo application. Clone the
`base` tag of this repo:

```bash frame="terminal" wrap title="SSH version"
git clone --depth=1 --branch base git@github.com:Christopher2K/live-activity-example.git
```

or

```bash frame="terminal" wrap title="HTTPS version"
git clone --depth=1 --branch base https://github.com/Christopher2K/live-activity-example.git
```

> If you're using HTTPS, please do yourself a favor and upgrade to use
> [GitHub over SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)!

This project contains a blank Expo v52 application under the
[managed workflow](https://blog.expo.dev/expo-managed-workflow-in-2021-5b887bbf7dbb),
with Expo Router, Typescript and the developement client already setup. As we
are about to write custom native code, Expo will take care of **generating** an
XCode project that will be able to build allour non-standard stuff. It seems
complicated, but this is where Expo shines: it allows you to keep the benefits
of the managed workflow, while still being able to go out of the Expo way and do
weird stuff on both Android and iOS sides. All the benefits, without the native
headaches.

To see if this project is working, just run `npm install` and then,
`npx expo run:ios -d`, and then, select an iOS simulator. After the build
process, this is what you should see:

<Image
  src={blankAppScreenshot}
  alt="A screenshot of a blank Expo app running on an iOS simulator"
/>

Now that we have our base app, here's what we're going to build:

- Another iOS target that will contain our Live Activity; a target being an
  "extension" of your app like widgets, iMessage extensions, etc.
- A custom native module that will let our app to control the live activity

## Create an iOS target

[Evan Bacon 🥓](https://x.com/Baconbrix) (that's his real name) wrote an
[amazing experimental expo-plugin](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-apple-targets)
that can help you create and add another taget to your Expo app. We need this in
order to create a target for the live activity.

You can go ahead start the plugin installation by running:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-target
```

If everything goes well, you should see instructions on how to add the expo
plugin to your config file:

```text frame="terminal" title="Output" wrap
❯ npx create-target

Cannot automatically write to dynamic config at: app.config.ts
Please add the following to your Expo config
{
  "plugins": [
    "@bacons/apple-targets"
  ]
}
```

Go ahead, edit the `app.config.ts` file in the root folder and add the plugin to
the `plugins` array as shown above.

Run again the `npx create-target` command. Now with the plugin installed, you
should see a menu with all the targets you can add to your project. Use the
arrow keys to select `Widget` then, press enter Here's the output:

```text wrap title="Output" frame="terminal"
❯ npx create-target

[bacons/apple-targets] Expo config is missing required ios.appleTeamId property. Find this in Xcode and add to the Expo Config to correct. iOS builds may fail until this is corrected.
✔ Choose a target: › Widget
Writing expo-target.config.js file
Writing Info.plist file
Target created! Run npx expo prebuild -p ios to fully generate the target. Develop native code in Xcode.
```

> See the warning about `ios.appleTeamId`? Follow the instructions in the
> terminal to add it to your app.config.ts file

The process generated a `/targets/widget` folder with a bunch of Swift files in
it.

<Image src={widgetFolder} alt="A screenshot of the widget folder" />

Let's clean this up a bit, as we don't need the files unrelated to the live
activity itself.

```bash wrap
rm -rf targets/widget/WidgetControl.swift targets/widget/widgets.swift targets/widget/AppIntent.swift
```

Go to the `index.swift` file and remove the following lines as we deleted some
files:

```swift title="targets/widget/index.swift" del={8-9}
import WidgetKit
import SwiftUI

@main
struct exportWidgets: WidgetBundle {
    var body: some Widget {
        // Export widgets here
        widget()
        widgetControl()
        WidgetLiveActivity()
    }
}
```

What we're going to do next is edit the `targets.widget/expo-target.config.js`
file. This is basically a configuration file that will help Expo know what is
the target and what should be included when building it. Let's add all
frameworks (= libraries) we need for our live activity:

```js title="targets/widget/expo-target.config.js" ins={8}
/** @type {import('@bacons/apple-targets/app.plugin').ConfigFunction} */
module.exports = (config) => ({
  type: "widget",
  icon: "https://github.com/expo.png",
  entitlements: {
    /* Add entitlements */
  },
  frameworks: ["SwiftUI", "ActivityKit"],
});
```

`SwiftUI` and `ActivityKit` both contains the parts that we need to build out
the UI of our live activity

Next up, we need to configure our app so that it can support live activities. Go
to the `app.config.ts` and add the following:

```ts title="app.config.ts" ins={5-7}
const config: ExpoConfig = {
  // Your exiting config
  ios: {
    // Existing iOS config
    infoPlist: {
      NSSupportsLiveActivities: true,
    },
  },
};
```

We're all set for the target. Let's try to regenerate the XCode project and then
a native build to see if we didn't miss anything. In the project root folder,
run these commands:

```bash
rm -rf ios
npx expo prebuild -p ios
npx expo run:ios
```

Your app should build and run smoothly on your iOS simulator!

> If you're curious, check out the generated Podfile `ios/Podfile`. At the end
> of the file, expo-apple-targets plugin added some code to supports our new
> added target.

## Create a view for our live activity

This is the **fun** part as it involves writing **Swift UI code**, using
**XCode**. I love Swift but I **hate** XCode, but that's for another article...
Let's open our project under XCode with the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
xed ios
```

On XCode, open the `Project Navigator`. You should see a virtual folder
`expo:targets` containing our `widget` folder with all the files generated by
expo-apple-targets.

<Image
  src={xcodeTargetFolder}
  alt="A screenshot of the XCode project navigator"
/>

A live activity needs data from your app right? We have to define the shape of
the data we will be passing from the Typescript layer to the live activity.

In the widget folder, let's create a `Attributes.swift` file. We can start with
something simple: we're going to pass down a `String` and an `Int`.

```swift title="Attributes.swift"
import ActivityKit
import SwiftUI

public struct MyLiveActivityAttributes: ActivityAttributes {
  public struct ContentState: Codable & Hashable {}

  public typealias MyLiveActivityState = ContentState

  public let customString: String
  public let customNumber: Int
}
```

This file contains a struct that implements the protocol `ActivityAttributes`.
This protocol expects our struct to contain a sub-struct - `ContentState` - that
represents any data that can change (be updated) during the lifetime of the same
live activity. We are not going to use this feature in this article, but keep in
mind that it's something possible! Let's keep this sub-struct empty.

The properties of the root struct are the one that we will be passing down from
the Typescript layer.

Now, open the `WidgetLiveActivity.swift` and paste the following code:

```swift title='WidgetLiveActivity.swift'
import ActivityKit
import WidgetKit
import SwiftUI

struct WidgetLiveActivity: Widget {
    var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
      ActivityConfiguration(for: MyLiveActivityAttributes.self) { context in
            // Lock screen/banner UI goes here
            VStack {
              Text(context.attributes.customString)
            }
        } dynamicIsland: { context in
            DynamicIsland {
                // Expanded UI goes here.  Compose the expanded UI through
                // various regions, like leading/trailing/center/bottom
                DynamicIslandExpandedRegion(.leading) {
                    Text("Leading")
                }
                DynamicIslandExpandedRegion(.trailing) {
                    Text("Trailing")
                }
                DynamicIslandExpandedRegion(.bottom) {
                    Text("Bottom")
                }
            } compactLeading: {
                Text("L")
            } compactTrailing: {
                Text("T")
            } minimal: {
                Text("M")
            }
        }
    }
}

#Preview(
  "Lockscreen View",
  as: .content,
  using: MyLiveActivityAttributes(customString: "Hello World", customNumber: 1)
) {
  WidgetLiveActivity()
} contentStates: {
  MyLiveActivityAttributes.MyLiveActivityState()
}
```

This file represents the basic structure of a live activity view. It uses the
same syntax as other SwiftUI views. You can add UI for different states of the
live activity:

- when it's on the lock screen
- when it's expanded (phone is unlocked)
- when it's not expanded (phone is unlocked)
- when it doesn't have the priority and is on `minimal` mode

The data passed to the activity is inside the `context.attributes` property.

introduction by Apple themselves:
[SwiftUI Concept Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts)

## Create a native module to control the live activity

We have the target and its associated view ready. Let's create a way to start or
stop the live activity. We need our Typescript layer to be able to call a native
swift function. This is why
[Native modules](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/native-module-tutorial/) exists
and are so important. Creating one, when using Expo is straightforward. Let's
start by running the following command in the project root:

```bash title='Terminal'
npx create-expo-module@latest --local
```

As a name, enter `activity-controller` and then pick all the default options.
Here's what you should see:

```text frame='terminal' title='Output'
The local module will be created in the modules directory in the root of your project. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/expo-module-local-autolinking.md

✔ What is the name of the local module? … activity-controller
✔ What is the native module name? … ActivityController
✔ What is the Android package name? … expo.modules.activitycontroller

✔ Downloaded module template from npm
✔ Created the module from template files

✅ Successfully created Expo module in modules/activity-controller

You can now import this module inside your application.
For example, you can add this line to your App.js or App.tsx file:
import ActivityControllerModule './modules/activity-controller';

Learn more on Expo Modules APIs: https://docs.expo.dev/modules
Remember to re-build your native app (for example, with npx expo run) when you make changes to the module. Native code changes are not reloaded with Fast Refresh.
```

<Image
  src={modulesFolder}
  alt="A screenshot of the module folder in the project root"
/>

Let's do some cleanup. Let's remove all the files we don't need here:

```bash title='Terminal'
rm -rf \
modules/activity-controller/android \
modules/activity-controller/src/ActivityControllerModule.web.ts \
modules/activity-controller/ios/ActivityControllerView.swift \
modules/activity-controller/src/ActivityControllerView.*
```

Then, edit `modules/activity-controller/expo-module.config.json` to remove the
`android` configuration object:

```json title='modules/activity-controller/expo-module.config.json' del={2,7-9} ins={3}
{
  "platforms": ["apple", "android", "web"],
  "platforms": ["apple"],
  "apple": {
    "modules": ["ActivityControllerModule"]
  },
  "android": {
    "modules": ["expo.modules.activitycontroller.ActivityControllerModule"]
  }
}
```

Lastly, create an android-only stub file for our module:

```bash title='Terminal'
touch modules/activity-controller/src/ActivityControllerModule.android.ts
```

Alright let's write some code then. We need two functions, one to start the live
activity and one to stop it. Open the `ActivityController.types.ts` file and
replace the content with the following:

```ts title='modules/activity-controller/src/ActivityController.types.ts'
export type LiveActivityParams = {
  customString: string;
  customNumber: number;
};

export type StartLiveActivityFn = (
  params: LiveActivityParams,
) => Promise<{ activityId: string }>;

export type StopLiveActivityFn = () => Promise<void>;

export type IsLiveActivityRunningFn = () => boolean;
```

This represents the contract our module has to follow on the native side. Open
`modules/activity-controller/src/ActivityControllerModule.ts` and replace the
content with the following:

```ts title='modules/activity-controller/src/ActivityControllerModule.ts'
import { requireNativeModule } from "expo";

import * as types from "./ActivityController.types";

const nativeModule = requireNativeModule("ActivityController");

export const startLiveActivity: types.StartLiveActivityFn = async (params) => {
  const stringParams = JSON.stringify(params);
  return nativeModule.startLiveActivity(stringParams);
};

export const stopLiveActivity: types.StopLiveActivityFn = async () => {
  return nativeModule.stopLiveActivity();
};

export const isLiveActivityRunning: types.IsLiveActivityRunningFn = () => {
  return nativeModule.isLiveActivityRunning();
};

export const areLiveActivitiesEnabled: boolean =
  nativeModule.areLiveActivitiesEnabled;
```

Do the same for the android stub file:

```ts title='modules/activity-controller/src/ActivityControllerModule.android.ts'
export const startLiveActivity: types.StartLiveActivityFn = async () => {
  return Promise.resolve({ activityId: "" });
};

export const stopLiveActivity: types.StopLiveActivityFn = async () => {
  return;
};

export const isLiveActivityRunning: types.IsLiveActivityRunningFn = () => {
  return false;
};

export const areLiveActivitiesEnabled: boolean = false;
```

And now, let's edit our barrel file to export those functions:

```ts title='modules/activity-controller/index.ts'
export * from "./src/ActivityController.types";
export * from "./src/ActivityControllerModule";
```

We have everything **_en place_** to start and stop the live activity on the
React Native side. Now, we can focus on the real deal, the native code.

First of all - and this is a limitation that I couldn't get around - we need to
duplicate the `Attributes.swift` file previously created. The native module
needs access to this code to start the live activity and there is not easy way
to share it between the target and the controller module.

```bash title='Terminal'
cp targets/widget/Attributes.swift modules/activity-controller/ios/Attributes.swift
```

We need the exact same struct on both target and controller. Keep in mind that
if you edit one of them, you have to duplicate the changes in the other one.
Regenerate and re-open the project in XCode.

```base title='Terminal'
rm -rf ios
npx expo prebuild -p ios
xed ios
```

In the `Project Navigator`, expands the `Pods` project, then expand
`Development Pods`. Look for the ActivityController folder and expand it as
well. This is a symlink to the native module folder we just created earlier.

<Image
  src={xcodeModuleFolder}
  alt="A screenshot of the ActivityController folder in XCode"
/>

In the `ActivityControllerModule.swift`, we're going to create the function our
Typescript module is calling.

```swift title='ActivityControllerModule.swift'
import ActivityKit
import SwiftUI
import ExpoModulesCore

    }

    Function("isActivityRunning") { () -> Bool in
      return isActivityRunning()
    }
  }
}
```

This is a quite a long file that does few things. The first and most important
is that we're creating a `ModuleDefinition` that will basically expose functions
we can call or property we can access to, from our Typescript layer. This is an
API given by Expo, through
[Expo Modules](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/overview/). Around this class
definition, you can find some helper functions and structs that we're using just
to make our code more readable.

You can also notice that we're having a bunch of `@available(iOS 16.2, *)`
decorators and if checks. This is because Live Activities API doesn't exist
prior to this iOS version. This is away to avoid our native code calling
something that doesn't exist on the device.

Let's try to run our project now.

```bash title='Terminal'
npx expo run:ios
```

If you're project is running, (and it will, because this article is not written
using AI) you're gucci. Now let's test our implementation. Go to `app/index.tsx`
and replace the content with the following code:

```tsx title='app/index.tsx'
import { useState } from "react";
import { StyleSheet, View, Text, TouchableOpacity } from "react-native";

import {
  startLiveActivity,
  stopLiveActivity,
  isLiveActivityRunning,
} from "#modules/activity-controller";

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    textAlign: "center",
    fontWeight: "bold",
    marginTop: 10,
  },
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
  },
  buttonContainer: {
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    marginTop: 10,
    gap: 5,
  },
  button: {
    marginTop: 10,
    padding: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
    backgroundColor: "#007AFF",
    color: "white",
  },
  buttonText: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: "white",
  },
});

export default function Index() {
  const [activityIsRunning, setActivityIsRunning] = useState(
    () => isLiveActivityRunning,
  );

  const handleStartLiveActivity = () => {
    startLiveActivity({
      customString: "Live Activity Testing",
      customNumber: 123,
    });
  };

  const handleStopLiveActivity = () => {
    stopLiveActivity();
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Live Activity Testing app</Text>
      <View style={styles.buttonContainer}>
        <TouchableOpacity
          style={styles.button}
          onPress={handleStartLiveActivity}
        >
          <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Start Live Activity</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>

        <TouchableOpacity
          style={styles.button}
          onPress={handleStopLiveActivity}
        >
          <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Stop Live Activity</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}
```

It gives you a view with two buttons, one to start the live activity and one to
stop, using our native module typescript interface. Check your simulator, press
the "Start the live activity" button and lock the simulator. You should see it!

<Image

  alt="A screenshot of the live activity running on the simulator"

This is a bare example of how to use Expo, Expo Module, Expo Apple Targets and
SwiftUI to create something that isn't available out of the box with React
Native.

This is just the beginning, but enough and prod ready to make stuff that are
deeply integrated with iOS. In the next article, I'll experiment with
bi-directional interaction between the widget and the Typescript code, and code
sharing between the target and the native module. I hope you enjoyed this
article and found it useful! If you have any question, feel free to reach out on
