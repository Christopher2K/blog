Well, I have to admit that I feel excited: CodeCrafters is my first "real"
partnership as a streamer. But, being a person who is built differently, I make
it a point to only associate myself with projects and concepts that I find cool,
and that I could personally use. CodeCrafters is that kind of product. It's
simple, it's cool, and it STIMULATES me. Here's my experience with this code
challenge platform!

## A code challenge platform?

CodeWars. CodeInGames. LeetCode. HackerRank. Maybe you've heard of them. If you
haven't, these are websites that allow developers to practice their craft. The
topics covered go from simple algorithmic subjects to solving complex problems.
Some people use them out of curiosity, while others see these platforms as a way
to prove how incredible they are as developers.

Practice Writing Complex Software. Recreate Redis, Git, Docker â€” with your own
hands. Gain expert-level confidence by taking action and diving deep, learning
from the world's best."
/>

CodeCrafters adds to these many platforms with a curious specificity: you will
practice on real products; and you will challenge yourself with missions like
`Build your own <something>`. By **real products**, I mean things like:

- Docker,
- SQLite,
- BitTorrent,
- Redis,
- and many other to comeâ€¦

/>

Yeah, it's really intimidating. Right now, I have no freaking idea how products
like Docker can work internally, and it's obvious that rebuilding this thing
from scratch would be impossible for me.

To make the experience enjoyable, CodeCrafters will shine through its iterative
approach: your challenge will be divided into much more manageable
sub-challenges.

  alt="Sub goal details: Introduction,
Repository setup, Decode bencoded strings - integers - lists - objects, Parse
torrent files, Calculate info hash, Piece hashes, Peer handshake, Download a
piece, Download the whole file."
/>

You will also have the opportunity to test your code at each step, to make sure
you are going in the right direction.

The experience is SUPER enjoyable: there is a Discord server for support (thatâ€™s
cool to have that, because we never know!) and the maintainers regularly add new
challenges!

## My own usage

I started with the Redis challenge in Elixir and my first attempt ended in
failure, my first L ever.

Itâ€™s NOT to my skill issues, the platform was down for a few minutes. These are
things that happen, how many of us have already killed a production server, huh?

I gave a second chance by attempting another challenge, the Build your own
BitTorrent client. I know the software, I donâ€™t know about the protocol, but I
was able to learn a lot by completing the challenge. Here is what I took away
from it:

- The Bencode encoding technique,
- What I can find inside a torrent file,
- How the file behind the torrent is downloaded.

As you can see, the impact on my IT culture is really positive, perfect for
shining in society (if the society in question was filled with geeks, which is
far from the truth).

At the time of writing, I am at stage 9 of the challenge and have invested
approximately 8 hours so far. I really love the concept and I think I will do
more on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv//LLCoolChris_) using different programming
languages!
